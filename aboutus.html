<h1>Overview</h1>
<hr>
<br>

<p>In Davao City, many youth from marginalized communities face significant barriers to accessing quality education due to poverty, lack of resources, unequal opportunities, geographic isolation and inadequate school infrastructure. This issue is aligned with Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 4: Quality Education, which promotes inclusive and equitable education for all. Addressing this problem is important because education supports social mobility, economic development, and community stability. A dedicated website is a useful tool for raising awareness, sharing information, connecting stakeholders, and encouraging action. It can serve as a central platform to support efforts toward equal access to education in Davao City.</p>

 Building Future's primary goal is to address the pressing issue of unequal access to quality education in Davao City by establishing a community-centered platform that unites students, parents, educators, and policymakers. Our website seeks to go beyond mere information sharing by directly confronting systemic challenges such as affordability, infrastructure, and inclusivity, which often prevent children from receiving the education they deserve. By emphasizing accessibility as a core value, our initiative is designed to provide equitable opportunities for learning and growth, regardless of a child’s socioeconomic background or geographic location. Through collaboration and the exchange of practical solutions, our platform aims to raise awareness, inspire collective action, and bridge the educational divide. Ultimately, our goal is to become a catalyst for meaningful change, contributing to the long-term advancement of Davao City’s human capital and fostering a more just and inclusive society.
