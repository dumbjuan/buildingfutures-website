<p> <b><i>Building Futures</i></b> is an advocacy campaign that fights for equal access to education among <br>children and youth. Our purpose is to help address the pressing and long-time issue in society – the lack of <br>access to education. By doing so, we aim to establish a community-centered platform through a website that <br>advocates for education among the underprivileged and out-of-school youth and children. We desire to unite <br>the students, parents, educators, and the government to have a commonality in fighting for what the children <br>and youth deserve — and that is a bright and secure future. </p>
